# TREENDER

AN APP THAT WILL HELP US CUT DOWN ON TREES (FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY) BY STARTING TO RENT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR THE FESTIVE SEASON
INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM.
Book your Christmas Tree, rent it, get it delivered, spend Christmas with it and water it regularly and finally send it back
when you're done.
Your conscience will be clearer and your Christmas tree will fulfill its "Christmas Destiny".

TREENDER was created in MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Stack using JavaScript by Timothée and Max, as a refresher project after our Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Paris.
